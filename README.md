## Some of the projects I'm working on
### JetLagS14 Solver
I was watching JetLag and was wondering what the optimal route would look like. Turns out, that's an NP-Hard problem! But since I have a known gameboard, and it's not tooo big, I thought it would be fun to still try to find it.

You can see the project [here](https://github.com/jespeste/JetLagS14)
