## Yup, this is my repository. Not that much to say about it. Kinda cool though.

## Some of the projects I'm working on
### JetLagS14 Solver
I was watching JetLag and was wondering what the optimal route would look like. Turns out, that's an NP-Hard problem! But since I have a known gameboard, and it's not tooo big, I thought it would be fun to still try to find it.

You can see the project [here](https://github.com/jespeste/JetLagS14)

### Personal finance desktop application in C
I really don't know how C works, and I would really like to create a decent desktop application. GTK to the rescue!

Will be done in GTK3 for easier access to documentation.

You can see the project [\<COMING SOON\>](https://google.com)
